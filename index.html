    <h1>Happy 1st Anniversary, Ashley</h1>

    <h2>
      My beautiful Ashley,<br>
      Today marks one full year of us â€” 365 days of laughter, love, growth, and unforgettable moments. And even after all this time, every time I see you, it still feels like the very first day my heart found its home.
    </h2>

    <p>
      Thereâ€™s something magical about the way you smile at me. Itâ€™s not just a look â€” itâ€™s a feeling. Itâ€™s warmth, comfort, excitement, and peace all wrapped into one. Youâ€™ve shown me that love isnâ€™t just about passion â€” itâ€™s about patience, understanding, and choosing one another every single day. And I choose you, Ashley, again and again, without hesitation.
    </p>

    <p>
      I remember our late-night talks, the way we laugh over the smallest things, and how just being near you makes the world feel calm. Iâ€™ve learned more about love from you than I ever thought possible. You love with your whole heart â€” purely, deeply, and fiercely â€” and Iâ€™m so lucky that Iâ€™m the one you love.
    </p>

    <p>
      Youâ€™ve supported me when I doubted myself. Youâ€™ve inspired me to be better. Youâ€™ve held my hand when I was unsure, and youâ€™ve reminded me who I am when I forgot. Youâ€™ve brought out a version of me that Iâ€™m proud of â€” and I owe that to your faith in me and your endless love.
    </p>

    <p>
      I want you to know that you are my favorite person in this world. My safe space. My home. My reason to smile every morning and my comfort every night. If I could pause time, I would freeze every moment I get to spend with you â€” but since I can't, Iâ€™ll keep cherishing every second we're together.
    </p>

    <p>
      I came across this song that made me think of us â€” our moments, our journey, our future. Itâ€™s soft, full of feeling, and perfectly captures everything I feel inside.<br>

      Happy anniversary, my love. I canâ€™t wait to see where life takes us next. Through every challenge, every joy, and everything in between â€” Iâ€™ll be right by your side, holding your hand, loving you more each day.
    </p>

    <p>
      Hereâ€™s to one year of us. And to many more ahead. ðŸ’–
